== PacketSniff ==

This app takes a Network Interface and monitors TCP/UDP/ICMP traffic on the basis of their count, size and difference between the first and last packet of each protocol. Also it checks if a source ip sends more packets than a threshold and detects it as DoS attack. 

Eventually, it will log each run with full details in a file called "PacketSniff_log.txt".
